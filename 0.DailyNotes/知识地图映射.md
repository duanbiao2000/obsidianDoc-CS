Key Strategies:
1. **Read Documentation**: Review docs and README for project overview
2. **Analyze Structure**: Examine directory layout and module organization
3. **Find Core Flow**: Locate entry points and main call chains
4. **Use IDE Tools**: Leverage code navigation and analysis features
5. **Visualize**: Create diagrams for dependencies and workflows
6. **Document**: Note questions and insights while reviewing
7. **Study Tests**: Learn from test cases and examples

Improvement Plan:
- Choose appropriate tools (static analysis, docs generation)
- Monitor progress and adjust based on feedback

Key Concepts:

**System-Level Thinking**
- View code from architectural perspective
- Identify and analyze key system components and their interactions
- Start with docs, then drill down
- Avoid getting lost in details

**Information Synthesis** 
- Extract and analyze key data points from codebase and documentation
- Identify critical information patterns and relationships
- Systematically catalog important technical details
- Use visualization tools
- Focus on essential patterns

**Reverse Analysis**
- Analyze desired outcomes and work backwards to identify required steps
- Identify critical factors and dependencies:
  - Technical constraints and limitations
  - Resource requirements and availability
  - Key performance indicators (KPIs)
  - Risk factors and potential failure points
  - Integration points and interfaces
- Challenge assumptions

**Process Optimization**
- Map current workflows:
  - Document existing processes and procedures
  - Identify key stakeholders and responsibilities
  - Create detailed flowcharts and sequence diagrams
  - Analyze decision points and branching logic
  - Track data flow between system components
  - Note resource utilization patterns
  - Map dependencies and critical paths
- Find bottlenecks
- Measure and iterate

Implementation:
1. Create knowledge mapping
2. Document optimization process
3. Execute improvements
4. Measure results
5. Refine approach
