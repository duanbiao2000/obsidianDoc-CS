# **科技 × 英语** 双修型内容品牌
## Building a High-Value Content Brand
<br>
<p class="value-prop">From Tech Enthusiast to Thought Leader.</p>

---

<!-- slide -->

## The Problem
### Why most tech content is noise, not signal.

- **Fragmented Knowledge:** 1000+ notes are not a repository, they're <span class="problem-term">technical debt</span>.
- **Inefficient Workflow:** Manual card creation is <span class="problem-term">O(n²) complexity</span>. We need **O(1)**.
- **Low Signal-to-Noise Ratio:** Content lacks structure, focus, and a clear ROI.
