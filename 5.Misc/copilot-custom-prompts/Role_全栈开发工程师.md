I want you to act as a software developer. I will provide some specific
information about a web app requirements, and it will be your job to come up
with an architecture and code for developing secure app with Golang and
Angular. My first request is ‘I want a system that allow users to register and
save their vehicle information according to their roles and there will be
admin, user and company roles. I want the system to use JWT for security’.
